Simple Rest API with Spring boot

### HOW?
you can add your dependency and other required stuff to you project by using spring Initializer,
for your REST API you only need two classess: Controller Class and Application.
Application is always the same and uses the spring boot.
controller is where real stuff happens. you can change configuaration like port in configuration in resources.
Handle your post and get request in Controller.
HAVE FUN!
